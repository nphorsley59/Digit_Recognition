### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
Computer vision is a common application of machine learning algorithms. I used the MNIST dataset (shared as a Kaggle competition) to demonstrate the application of classification methods (SVM and KNN) and neural networks. The primary objective of the project was to train a model to recognize hand-written digits (0-9).
