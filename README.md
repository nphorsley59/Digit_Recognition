### <div align="center">Project Overview</div>
Computer vision is a common application of machine learning algorithms. I used the MNIST dataset (shared as a Kaggle competition) to demonstrate the application of classification methods (SVM and KNN) and neural networks to computer vision. The primary objective of the project was to train a model to recognize hand-written digits (0-9) in scanned, black-and-white images. For a more in-depth look at this analysis, please refer to my [Jupyter Notebook]().
